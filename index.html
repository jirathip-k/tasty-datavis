            Cooking is an essential part of life but it could be a hassle to
            organise grocery shopping lists and make a decision on recipes. This
            project could help making that decision easier.<br /><br />Click on
            the widget to view the details of each widget or click on the
            question mark to view all the details.<br /><br /><i

            a hidden grouping of similar ingredients. Therefore, these are
            unlabeled groupings of the ingredients.<br /><br />Moreover, it can
            be seen that only the top twelve ingredients by its importance are
            highlighted by colour and icons. These ingredients will be explored
            in the next few visualisations.

            centrality.<br /><br />In this visualisation, centrality is
            normalised to maximum at one for most connected ingredients.<br /><br />Moreover,
            each ingredient node can be hover to view its name and filter the
            links to only ones that are connected to that node.

            The visualisation provides information about common recipes for the

            Please hover at the ingredients' nodes to view recipe metrics that
            relate to the ingredient in the spider chart.<br /><br />The metrics
            in the spider chart were scaled to minimum of zero and maximum of
            one hundred grouped by ingredients. For example, if the lowest
            recipe's score in that ingredient group is 90 then it will be shown
            as zero in the chart.<br /><br />Moreover, you can hover at chart
            elements for each recipe to view recipe's name and unscaled
            metrics.<br /><br />Note that some of the observations cook time is
            zero because it is missing.
